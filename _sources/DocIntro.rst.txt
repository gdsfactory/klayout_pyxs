Writing PYXS files - an Introduction
====================================

Cross section files are simple to write. They provide a description how
to convert a planar layout into a vertical material stack. PYXS scripts
are really "scripts" - they are small programs which are executed by
KLayout's internal Python interpreter. Simple scripts can be written
without much knowledge of the Python language by following a simple
recipe. Complex scripts can utilize the full power of that scheme by
using loops, procedures, if statements and so on.

This document is an introduction into PYXS files. A reference with more
details about the functions, methods and their parameters is provided
here: :doc:`DocReference`.

Let us start with a simple example for a PYXS file:

.. code-block:: python

    # Prepare input layers
    m1 = layer("1/0")

    # "grow" metal on mask m1 with thickness 0.3 and lateral extension 0.1
    # with elliptical edge contours
    metal1 = mask(m1).grow(0.3, 0.1, mode='round')

    # output the material data to the target layout
    output("0/0", bulk)
    output("1/0", metal1)

With the following input:

.. image:: ./img/s1.png

This script will produce a simple cross section:

.. image:: ./img/s1_xs.png

PYXS files are basically Python scripts, so the syntax rules for the
Python language apply. Specifically:

* Comments start with a hash symbol (``#``)
* Functions and methods should list their parameters in round brackets
  after the function/method name (i.e. ``method(p1, p2)``)
* Layers and materials are variables and should start with a lower
  case letter (according to Python style guide
  `PEP-8 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_)
* Symbolic values (strings) are included in single or double quotes (i.e.
  ``'mode'`` or ``"round"``)
* Some names are reserved and cannot be used as layer or material
  names, i.e. ``or``, ``and``, ``if``, ``while``, ``def``, ``class`` etc.
  See full list here: `Built-in Functions <https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html>`_.

PYXS files typically consist of three sections: the layer preparation
step, the process description and the output section.

In the layer preparation step, mask layers are computed from design
layers. Often, mask data does not exactly correspond to design layers.
Mask data can be derived from design layers by:

* Sizing (shifting of the edges to the outside or inside of figures)
* Boolean operations between two design layers (AND, OR, NOT, XOR)
* Inversion of a layer

The design layer to mask conversion still happens in the xy plane,
looking at the chip layout from above. Once the computation has been
finished, the layout data now represents the mask data and is converted
to a litho pattern by using the "mask" function.
In our example, no conversion takes place, and the input layer
(layer 1, datatype 0) is directly taken to be mask data:

.. code-block:: python

    mask(m1)

The mask function will basically create the cut along the ruler and
prepare the mask to become a "seed" for subsequent grow and etch
operations. Note that using a mask seed is not mandatory. There are
also maskless operations (uniform deposit, epitaxy or planarization
steps) which do not require mask data.

In this example, there is just a single, mask-driven deposition step
which is performed on that mask. It uses the ``grow()`` method which is
applied to the litho pattern object using the ``.`` notation:

.. code-block:: python

    metal1 = mask(m1).grow(0.3, 0.1, mode='round')

``grow()`` is the method and the result of this is a "material" object.
In that case, we specify an "overgrow" with an elliptical profile. The
first argument of the ``grow()`` method is the thickness of the deposited
material in micrometers. The second argument is the lateral extension
(diffusion) in micrometer units. ``mode='round'`` is an option (a keyword
argument in Python) which specifies round or elliptical mode. In the
end, this specification will widen the original line of 0.4 micrometers
to 0.6 micrometers, because it will add 0.1 micrometers to each side
and produce a sheet thickness of 0.3 micrometers.

The ``grow()`` method is one of the two basic methods for the process
description. It can not only grow some material atop of the current
stack but also convert material below the surface to another material.
Find more about this method here: :doc:`DocGrow`.

A material object can be used later as a target of etch processes for
example. In our case, we simply output the material to an arbitrary
output layer (here layer 1, datatype 0):

.. code-block:: python

    output("0/0", bulk())
    output("1/0", metal1)

``bulk()`` is a pseudo-material which denotes the substrate. It is
written to layer 0, datatype 0 for illustration. In the screenshot,
the ``metal1`` material has been colored light red, the "bulk" material
is colored gray.

Variables and notation
----------------------

The above form of the script is not mandatory. ``m1`` and ``metal1`` are
variables which carry certain information. It is not required to store
this information in variables, except if the information is to be reused
in other places. Hence the computation of the ``metal1`` output can be
reduced to:

.. code-block:: python

    output("1/0", mask(layer("1/0")).grow(0.3, 0.1, mode='round'))

But obviously readability suffers, so the expanded notation used before
is recommended. But this example illustrates that there is no magic
behind the material names - they're just variables carrying certain
information. For the interested readers: instances of Python objects
of various kinds representing layout data or material data.

Input preparation
-----------------

As stated before, input data can be combined to produce mask data.
PYXS scripts use Python methods on layout data objects to implement
these operations:

.. code-block:: python

    l1 = layer("1/0")
    l2 = layer("2/0")
    # Boolean NOT between layer 1, datatype 0 and layer 2, datatype 0
    p = l1.not_(l2)

The same can be written more compactly if required. But again,
readability suffers:

.. code-block:: python

    p = layer("1/0").not_(layer("2/0"))

Other Boolean operations available are:

.. code-block:: python

    l1 = layer("1/0")
    l2 = layer("2/0")

    # Boolean OR between layer 1, datatype 0 and layer 2, datatype 0:
    p1 = l1.or_(l2)

    # Boolean AND between layer 1, datatype 0 and layer 2, datatype 0:
    p2 = l1.and_(l2)

    # Boolean XOR between layer 1, datatype 0 and layer 2, datatype 0:
    p3 = l1.xor(l2)

Layers can be sized (biased). Sizing will shift the edges by the
specified value in micrometer units. Positive values will shift the
edges to the outside of the figures, negative values to the inside.
Hence a positive value with increase the width of a line by twice that
value, a negative value will reduce the width by twice the value.
Negative values may make figures vanish fully or partially, positive
values may remove holes or gaps in the layout.

Sizing is available in two flavors: a modifying (in-place) version and
version delivering a sized copy (out-of-place). Both methods accept one
or two values. If one value is given, the bias will be applied in x
and y direction, with two values, the first bias will be applied in
horizontal direction, the other one in vertical direction.

.. code-block:: python

    l1 = layer("1/0")

    # p will be a copy of layer 1, datatype 0, sized by 0.2 micrometers:
    p = l1.sized(0.2)

    # this will modify l1 by sizing it with a value of 0.1 in x direction only:
    l1.size(0.1, 0)

Layers can be inverted. Again there is a in-place and out-of-place
version of that method:

.. code-block:: python

    l1 = layer("1/0")

    # Inverts the layer (modifies l1):
    l1.invert()

    # Returns an inverted copy (which is identical with layer 1, datatype 0 again):
    p = l1.inverted()

Caveat: Python and object references
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When assigning something to another variable it is easy to make a common
mistake: when Python assigns something to another variable, it will
(except for basic types) create another **reference** to the object,
not a copy. That has a strange consequence:

.. code-block:: python

    a = layer("1/0")
    b = a

    # this will invert "b" too, since b references the same object as a:
    a.invert()

To create a real copy, either use the out-of-place methods or use the
``dup()`` method which creates a copy:

.. code-block:: python

    # Solution 1:
    b = layer("1/0")
    a = b.inverted()

    # Solution 2:
    a = layer("1/0")
    b = a.dup()
    a.invert()

Material data is layout data too
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Material data derived from deposition methods is layout data too,
although not related to design layers. That allows to apply boolean
operations and sizing to material data as well:

.. code-block:: python

    l1 = layer("1/0")
    l2 = layer("2/0")

    metal1a = mask(l1).grow(0.1, 0.1, mode='round')
    metal1b = mask(l2).grow(0.1, 0.1, mode='round')

    output("1/0", metal1a.or_(metal1b))

Etch operations
---------------

The next sample script demonstrates the etch operation and mask-less
deposit methods. It is closer to a real process, which does not use
"mask-driven" grow but rather deposition and etch. It uses a layer
inversion to turn the polarity of the mask: etching has to happen where
no structure is drawn in order to produce the structure where it was
drawn.

.. code-block:: python

    # Prepare input layers
    m1 = layer("1/0")
    m1i = m1.inverted()

    # deposit metal with width 0.25 micron
    metal1 = deposit(0.25)

    substrate = bulk()

    # etch metal on mask m1 with thickness 0.3 and lateral extension 0.1
    # with elliptical edge contours
    mask(m1i).etch(0.3, 0.1, mode='round', into=[metal1, substrate])

    # output the material data to the target layout
    output("0/0", substrate)
    output("1/0", metal1)

With the following input:

.. image:: ./img/s2.png

This script will produce the following cross-section:

.. image:: ./img/s2_xs.png

The layer preparation step performs the inversion using the ``inverted()``
method:

.. code-block:: python

    m1 = layer("1/0")
    m1i = m1.inverted()

``m1i`` will be the inverted ``m1`` mask and will be used as the "seed" for
the etch.

Because we etch into the substrate we have to provide substrate as a
material too. This is achieved with the following assignment:

.. code-block:: python

    substrate = bulk()

``bulk()`` is a pseudo-material describing the wafer substrate. Initially
it is the wafer material below the surface. ``bulk()`` is a function,
so we have to create a material we can modify by storing the material
data object in a variable we call ``substrate``.

The etch step will now start from the inverted metal1 mask. Etch depth
will be 0.3 micrometers, and we specify an underetch of 0.1 micrometers
with elliptical profile. For the etch method we have to specify the
material our etch process will remove. There is no differentiation in
etch rate for these materials - they are assumed to behave the same way.
Materials not listed will effectively form an etch stop.

The materials the etch method will remove are listed with the ``into``
parameter. This named parameter is mandatory for the etch method.
The argument of that parameter is a material object or an array of
objects, if multiple materials are to be removed. Arrays are formed by
enclosing the list in square brackets:

.. code-block:: python

    mask(m1i).etch(0.3, 0.1, mode='round', into=[metal1, substrate])

Because we etch deeper (0.3) than the sheet we have deposited before
(0.25), we will remove a little bit of substrate as well. Note also,
that we reduce the line with from 0.8 (drawn) to 0.6 at the top edge of
the metal line. This bias will typically be compensated by a sizing
operation when the mask data is prepared in a real process.

Find details about the ``etch()`` method here: :doc:`DocEtch`.

Backside processing
-------------------

The last sample script demonstrates combinations of process steps and
backside processing. Here is the script:

.. code-block:: python

    # Specify wafer thickness
    depth(1)

    # Prepare input layers
    m1 = layer("1/0").inverted()
    m2 = layer("2/0")

    # deposit metal with width 0.25 micron
    metal1 = deposit(0.25)

    substrate = bulk()

    # etch metal on mask m1 with thickness 0.3 and lateral extension 0.1
    # with elliptical edge contours
    mask(m1).etch(0.3, 0.1, mode='round', into=[metal1, substrate])

    # process from the backside
    flip()

    # backside etch, taper angle 4 degree
    mask(m2).etch(1, taper=4, into=substrate)

    # fill with metal and polish
    metal2 = deposit(1.1)
    planarize(downto=substrate, into=metal2)

    # output the material data to the target layout
    output("0/0", substrate)
    output("1/0", metal1.or_(metal2))

With the following input:

.. image:: ./img/s3.png

This script will produce the following cross section:

.. image:: ./img/s3_xs.png

The topside processing part is the same than the previous sample and
produces a metal structure at the top of the wafer. For backside
processing, it is important to specify the wafer thickness. For
illustration we use an unreasonably small value of 1 micrometer:

.. code-block:: python

    depth(1)

The interesting part starts with this line:

.. code-block:: python

    flip()

This will basically turn the wafer and processing now happens from the
backside. You can flip again to return to top side processing. We use a
sequence of operations to create a filled through-silicon via:

.. code-block:: python

    # backside etch, taper angle 4 degree
    mask(m2).etch(1, taper=4, into=substrate)

    # fill with metal and polish
    metal2 = deposit(0.3, 0.3, mode='square')
    planarize(downto=substrate, into=metal2)


The etch step is configured to produce a tapered hole with a taper angle
of 4 degree. The initial (now bottom) dimension of the hole is defined
by the ``m2`` mask which is shown in blue color in the layout and the
structure has a dimension of 0.4 micrometers.

After the hole has been etched, we deposit a metal layer thick enough
to fill the hole. 0.3 micrometer layer thickness is sufficient. The
deposition will cover the side walls of the hole and fill the hole
completely. Square mode is creating a square profile which is not
realistic, but computationally simple.

The deposition will also create metal at the bottom side of the wafer
which we polish away with a planarization step. The planarization step
is similar to a maskless etch, but it will remove the specified material
down to a certain depth. This stop condition is defined either by a
planarization stop material (here: substrate) or by a threshold value.

On output we merge both metal types (front and backside deposited
material) to form a joined metal structure:

.. code-block:: python

    output("1/0", metal1.or_(metal2))
