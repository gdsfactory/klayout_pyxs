.. _DocGrow:

The ``grow()`` Method
=====================

The ``grow()`` method is one of the basic methods for describing a process.
It is called on a mask data object. The basic use case is:

.. code-block:: python

    l1 = layer("1/0")
    metal = mask(l1).grow(0.3)
    output("1/0", metal)

This simple case deposits a material where the layer is drawn with a
rectangular profile.

The ``grow()`` method has up to two arguments and a couple of options which
have to be put after the arguments in the usual Python keyword notation
``name=value``:

``grow(height, lateral=0, option=value...)``

The ``height`` argument is mandatory and specifies the thickness of the
layer grown. The ``lateral`` parameter specifies the lateral extension
(overgrow, diffusion). The lateral extension is optional and defaults
to 0. The lateral extension can be negative. In that case, the profile
will be aligned with the mask at the bottom. Otherwise it is aligned
at the top.

There are several options:

.. list-table::
    :widths: 10 60
    :header-rows: 1

    * - Option
      - Value
    * - ``mode``
      - | The profile mode. Can be ``'round'``, ``'square'`` and
        | ``'octagon'``. The default is 'square'.
    * - ``taper``
      - | The taper angle. This option specifies tapered mode and cannot
        | be combined with ``'mode'``.
    * - ``bias``
      - | Adjusts the profile by shifting it to the interior of the
        | figure. Positive values will reduce the line width by twice
        | the value.
    * - ``on``
      - | A material or an array of materials onto which the material
        | is deposited (selective grow). The default is ``'all'``. This
        | option cannot be combined with ``"into"``. With ``"into"``,
        | ``"through"`` has the same effect than ``"on"``.
    * - ``into``
      - | Specifies a material or an array of materials that the new
        | material should consume instead of growing upwards. This
        | will make "grow" a "conversion" process like an implant step.
    * - ``through``
      - | To be used together with "into". Specifies a material or an
        | array of materials to be used for selecting grow. Grow will
        | happen starting on the interface of that material with air,
        | pass through the ``through`` material (hence the name) and
        | consume and convert the ``into`` material below.
    * - ``buried``
      - | Applies the conversion of material at the given depth below
        | the mask level. This is intended to be used together with
        | ``into`` and allows modeling of deep implants. The value is
        | the depth below the surface.

``mode``, ``taper`` and ``bias``
--------------------------------

The effect of the ``mode`` and ``bias`` interaction is best illustrated with
some examples.

The initial layout is always this in all following examples:

.. image:: ./img/g1.png

The first example if the effect of the plain grow with a thickness of
0.3 um. It will deposit a rectangular material profile at the mask:

.. code-block:: python

    grow(0.3)

.. image:: ./img/g1_xs.png

The next example illustrates the effect of a lateral extension on a
square profile. The 0.1 um extension will add material left and right of
the main patch:

.. code-block:: python

    grow(0.3, 0.1)

.. image:: ./img/g2_xs.png

In ``'round'`` mode, the material will be deposited with an elliptical
profile. The vertical axis will be 0.3 um, the horizontal 0.1 um
representing the laternal extension. The patch will become bigger than
the mask by the lateral extension at the bottom:

.. code-block:: python

    grow(0.3, 0.1, mode='round')

.. image:: ./img/g3_xs.png

To avoid overgrow, a negative lateral extension can be specified,
resulting in a alignment of patch and mask at the bottom:

.. code-block:: python

    grow(0.3, -0.1, mode='round')

.. image:: ./img/g4_xs.png

Another mode is ``'octagon'`` which is basically a coarse approximation
of the ellipse and computationally less expensive:

.. code-block:: python

    grow(0.3, 0.1, mode='octagon')

.. image:: ./img/g5_xs.png

A ``bias`` value can be specified to fine-tune the position of the bottom
edge of the patch. A *positive* bias value will *shrink* the figure:

.. code-block:: python

    grow(0.3, 0.1, mode='round', bias=0.05)

.. image:: ./img/g6_xs.png

A special profile can be specified with the ``taper`` option. This option
specifies a taper angle and a conical patch will be created. The taper
angle will be the sidewall angle of the patch. This option cannot be
combined with ``mode`` and the lateral extension should be omitted. It can
be combined with ``bias`` however:

.. code-block:: python

    grow(0.3, taper=10)

.. image:: ./img/g7_xs.png

.. code-block:: python

    grow(0.3, taper=10, bias=-0.1)

.. image:: ./img/g8_xs.png

Step coverage
-------------

The following image shows the step coverage of a 30Â° slope and a
vertical step by a material deposited in round mode with thickness of
0.3 um and lateral extension of 0.1 um. The sidewall of the step will be
covered with a thickness of 0.1 um corresponding to the lateral
extension:

.. code-block:: python

    grow(0.3, 0.1, mode='round')

.. image:: ./img/g10_xs.png

``on`` - growing on specific material
-------------------------------------

The ``on`` option allows to select growth on a material surface in
addition to selection by a mask. To do so, specify the array of
materials or the single material on which the new material will be
deposited. The surface of these substrate materials will form the seed
of the growth process.

An array of materials is written as a list of material data objects in
square brackets.

.. code-block:: python

    # Prepare input layers
    m1 = layer("1/0")
    m2 = layer("2/0")

    # Grow a stop layer
    stop = mask(m2).grow(0.05)

    # Grow with mask m1, but only where there is a substrate surface
    metal = mask(m1).grow(0.3, 0.1, mode='round', on=bulk())

    # output the material data to the target layout
    output("0/0", bulk())
    output("1/0", metal)
    output("2/0", stop)

Here is the input data:

.. image:: ./img/g12.png

And this is the result:

.. image:: ./img/g12_xs.png


``into`` - converting material
------------------------------

With the ``into`` option it is possible to convert material below the
mask rather than growing upwards. ``into`` specifies a single material
or an array of materials in square brackets. In effect, the direction
is reversed and the material given by ``into`` is consumed and replaced
by the new material. Note: the ``etch`` operation is basically doing the
same, replacing the material by "air".

.. code-block:: python

    # Prepare input layers
    m1 = layer("1/0")
    m2 = layer("2/0")

    substrate = bulk()

    # Grow with mask m1 into the substrate
    metal = mask(m1).grow(0.3, 0.1, mode='round', into=substrate)

    # output the material data to the target layout
    output("0/0", substrate)
    output("1/0", metal)

This script gives the following result:

.. image:: ./img/g13_xs.png

``through`` - selective conversion
----------------------------------

The same way that ``on`` will make the grow selective on the chosen
materials, ``through`` will select seed materials for conversion with
``into``. Conversion will start at the interface between ``through`` and
air and consume the materials of ``into``. It will not consume the
``through`` materials:

.. code-block:: python

    # Prepare input layers
    m1 = layer("1/0")
    m2 = layer("2/0")

    substrate = bulk()

    stop = mask(m2).grow(0.05, into=substrate)

    # Grow with mask m1 into the substrate
    metal = mask(m1).grow(0.3, 0.1, mode='round', through=stop, into=substrate)

    # output the material data to the target layout
    output("0/0", substrate)
    output("1/0", metal)
    output("2/0", stop)

With the following input:

.. image:: ./img/g14.png

This script gives the following result:

.. image:: ./img/g14_xs.png

``buried`` - applies a conversion in a region below the surface
---------------------------------------------------------------

If ``buried`` parameter is given, the process is not applied on the
surface, but at the given depth below the surface. The main application
is to model deep implants. In that case, ``into`` can be given to specify
the material to convert and ``buried`` will specify the depth at which the
material is converted. The region of conversion extends below and above
that depth:

.. code-block:: python

    # Prepare input layers
    m1 = layer("1/0")
    m2 = layer("2/0")

    substrate = bulk()

    # Grow with mask m1 into the substrate
    metal = mask(m1).grow(0.3, 0.1, mode='round', into=substrate, buried=0.4)

    # output the material data to the target layout
    output("0/0", substrate)
    output("1/0", metal)

With the following input:

.. image:: ./img/g15.png

This script gives the following result:

.. image:: ./img/g15_xs.png
